In 2020, I started getting more interested in data science. That journey led me to geospatial data science. I started teaching myself the basics, then eventually decided to enroll in a formal program to speed things along. Here are a few of my creations from my journey so far.

Above is one of the first maps I made when I started out and was learning GeoPandas on my own. It's a map of all the buildings in my neighborhood in Portland, colored by the year they were built. Even though it was pretty much just out-of-the-box GeoPandas with no special effort put in, I thought it was pretty cool. Older buildings are darker, newer lighter. My previous house and my current house are both visible and are on the far ends of the color range: 1910 and 2015! The building data came from PortlandMaps Open Data (https://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/)

The next one was for a lab assignment in my master's program. It was for a module on symbolization in *Cartographic Design and Visualization*. The challenge of this assignment was coming up with dot-density symbolization that didn't misrepresent areas: Getting the colors, the dot size, the drawing order, and the ratio of people-to-dots right so that they all worked well together. I made this one in ArcGIS Pro. I was pretty happy with how it turned out.

From one kind of race to another, this map was for another cartography lab assignment, also made in ArcGIS Pro. This one had a few different requirements. First was styling the elevation: We had to work in hillshade, multi-directional hillshade, coloring, and contour lines. We also had to fit in the race elevation profile, locator map, and come up with the race-course symbology for overlapping routes. This was a fun one.

This was another lab assignment. We had to work two critical breaks in there and use a divergent color scheme. I now understand the downsides to choropleth maps, but I've always enjoyed looking at them. This type of map is one of the things that drew me into geospatial in the first place.
